                    <h2>The Evolution Detriment</h2>
                    <br><br>
                    Human emotions have been shaped by survival of the fitness. The emotional traits that is most favorable to survival are passed on. Love gives us purpose to live, fear refrains us from taking risky decisions, violence is paramount in protecting ourselves and who we care for, being adventurous leads to fertile land, but at the same time being content so we settle and build.
                    <br><br>
                    These emotions evolved over tens of thousands of years, are embedded deep within each and every one of us. And with the rapid advancement of humanity in the last few centuries, some of these emotional traits that was once favourable for survival have now become a detriment. In today's world, we no longer need to be fearful, nor is there the need to feel violent to survive, yet we feel these emotions nonetheless.
                    <br><br>
                    Understanding why we feel what we feel, places us in a better position to control how we feel. It provides a new perspective to determine whether our feelings are appropriate in the context of today's world. Questioning, adjusting, manifesting, frees us from our tribal instinct.
                    <br><br>
                    Otherwise, we are being held captive from our very own evolution.

                    <H2>What is the meaning of life?</H2>
                    <br><br>
                    I don't believe there is a meaning to life, in the sense that there is no intent behind life. If there was an entity, in any shape or form, that created our universe, I don't believe life was an intention of their creation. In other words, I believe life in its totality is accidental.
                    <br><br>
                    The beautiful irony is this belief encourages me to live life in a more meaningful way. Believing life is accidental, that there is no higher purpose, puts me at ease from chasing the unattainable and instead allow me to enjoy all the beauty of life.
                    <br><br>
                    Life is nothing more than atoms dancing in space and time.
